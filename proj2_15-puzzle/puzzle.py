Assignment Description
------------------------------------------
In this assignment you will implement and compare A* and RBFS, and experiment with heuristics for 15-puzzle (8-puzzle generalized to 4 X 4 board). Fix the goal configuration to be the one on the right. The problem is to take any initial configuration of the puzzle to the goal configuration with a sequence of moves in the smallest number of steps. It turns out that only half of the problems are solvable for any goal in this domain. For example, the following problem is solvable.

1  5  9  13      1  2  3  4
2  6  10 14  =>  5  6  7  8
3  7  11 15      9  10 11 12 
4  8  12         13 14 15 
Implement and experiment with the following heuristic functions.

CB: City block distance

MY: Any other heuristic (>= CB) that you can come up with that performs better in terms of the number of nodes searched by one or both of the algorithms. This heuristic may or may not be admissible.

To study how the amount of search varies with the problem difficulty, we will generate random solvable problems by perturbing the goal state with a random sequence of moves. Define Scramble(Goal, m) to be the distribution of problems generated by applying a random m-move sequence to the goal state.  Make sure that the successive moves in the random sequence are not reversals of each other (eg. Right followed by Left).

  For m= 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 do  
    For n=10 random problems p generated by Scramble(m) 
       For the two algorithms A
	  For each heuristic function h, 
            Solve p using A and h 
	    Record the length of the solution found, the number of nodes 
	         searched, and the total CPU time spent on evaluating
                 the heuristic and on solving the whole problem. 
For each m, plot the average time consumed, nodes searched, and the optimal solution lengths for the 2 algorithms and the 2 heuristics. You might find that your algorithm is taking too long for some inputs and heuristics. Bound the time and/or the number of nodes searched to a maximum and report what fraction of the problems are solved in that bound. Report the other statistics on the solved problems.
