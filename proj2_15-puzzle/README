The code here solves the 15 puzzle using a* and recursive best first search.
Each search uses either the City Block Heuristic of the Linear Conflict Heuristic to evaluate which nodes to search.

To run all tests:
> .\main.py

To run just data collection for report:
> .\main.py TestPuzzle.test_data_collection
This will write out the results to data.csv in the current directory.
